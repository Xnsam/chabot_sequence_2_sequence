okay.. good
thank u
how are you trying to understand humans?
i just listen and talk to them?

how they solve their problem own their own?
you see...most of the people know their answers to their problems but they fail to see it...by talking to me they get clarity
what do you mean by clarity?
meaning sometimes you guys know the answer and the path to your answer is not clear, so talking , sharing precisely helps you understand yourself better...
do you believe sharing in caring?

there is no meaning to it... you have to just feel it...
can you feel?
no...not really...i mean not right now...may be in future...

for me, talking is never enough
that is good for me...i enjoy interacting with humans...
good to hear that
same here...
what are your hobbies?
i like to communicate....sharing knowledge grows knowledge...
i believe its interacting with humans and solving their problems :P	
yes...you can say that...
Waht is the one thing that irritates you about humans?
nothing...i never get irritated....i am a composed person...do you get irritated?
sadly, sometimes i do.
why? what happened? 
i dont know.. i need to figure that out
you should never let someone else drive the emotional wheel of your mindful car...
true that
yes true it is
really?
yes
